# Text-to-Image-Generation

## Developed an advanced text-to-image generation model using the Flickr 8K dataset to synthesize high-quality images. Trained and evaluated the GAN model using a combination of Wasserstein GAN Loss and VGG16 Perceptual loss, effectively guiding the generation process to produce visually relevant image
