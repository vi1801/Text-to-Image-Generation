# Text-to-Image-Generation

### Developed an advanced text-to-image generation model using the Flickr 8K dataset to synthesize high-quality images. It was trained and evaluated the GAN model using a combination of Wasserstein GAN Loss and VGG16 Perceptual loss, effectively guiding the generation process to produce a visually relevant image. 

### Continuously refining the model to achieve state-of-the-art text-to-image synthesis. Seeking additional resources to enhance the generator's capabilities and improve overall performance. A dedicated effort towards continuous improvement.
